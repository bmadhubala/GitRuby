Study Drills

    Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.
    Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby.

Common Student Questions

Can I make a variable like this: 1 = 'Zed Shaw'?
    No, 1 is not a valid variable name. They need to start with a character, so a1 would work, but 1 will not.
Why does this not make sense to me?
    Try making the numbers in this script your measurements. It's weird, but talking about yourself will make it seem more real. Also, you're just starting out so it won't make too much sense. Keep going and more exercises will explain it more.
